If laravel page views properly, Laravel setup is completed..

=====================================================

Using cmd
Get into the laravel project folder
Ex: D:\htdocs\InventoryProject\Firose
create folder milestone, and get into it, then clone project files from repository
mkdir milestone
cd milestone
git clone https://github.com/MilestoneInnovativeTechnologies/eleoi.git

Add to laravel root composer.json
autoload
	"files": ["milestone/eleoi/helpers.php"]
autoload > psr-4
	"Milestone\\Eleoi\\": "milestone/eleoi/src/"

Add to config > app > providers
	\Milestone\SmartKitchen\EleoiServiceProvider::class,

Correct config > app > timezone Ex: Asia/Kolkata
Create Database and set details in env file
Run
php artisan migrate:fresh

If need dummy data, then copy data files to storage > app, then run
php artisan db:seed --class=Milestone\Eleoi\Seeders\DatabaseSeeder

=====================================================

run
php artisan vendor:publish --force
then enter number corresponding to EleoiServiceProvider from the list

run
npm install
for istalling node modules

npm run dev
for starting dev server. Please note the port number from console. Browse for 
http://<name>:<port> to load the page. Ex: http://oifirose:9000

for production, run
npm run build

=====================================================

Publishing Assets - Different methods
php artisan vendor:publish --force
eleoi-assets: All javascript,stylesheets,fonts. No need to publish this frequently
eleoi-install: All required files for starting developement using quasar.. Quasar source files and package.json files.. No need to do publish frequently.
eleoi-resources: All required files for starting developement using quasar.. Quasar source files and package.json files..  No need to do publish frequently. Publish only when github updated and needed the source codes changes, but not compiled assets
eleoi-updates: All assets and resource files.. This need to be published when github updated, and starting developement from it.

=====================================================

Shifting between development and production..
When appending the browser url with port number, it will be shifted to development
Please note, development will be available only if npm run dev should be called and its running..
If no port appended, or serving on port 80, then production assets will be used and served...

=====================================================

When building,All the source files of package will be updated..
Initially deleted every files and folders from package's public/assets and all files from public
Then copies every files from dist/spa to package's public folder (except index.html)[Which is not required there as index page serves from laravel view]
After that, quasar src folder files will be copied to packages install/src..
Once this done, extracts js and css file names from dist/spa/index.html and stores as assets.json in packages public/assets
Finally, package's public folder will be copied to laravels public folder
